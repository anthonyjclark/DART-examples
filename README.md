# DART-examples

A few simple DART examples.

Build with:

```bash
./build build <example-name>
```

Run with

```bash
./build run <example-name>
```

The build script adds `$HOME/.local/include` to the include path, and `$HOME/.local/lib` to the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.

## Revisit Logger

Use the following to add the `logger` submodule:

```bash
hub submodule update --init
```
